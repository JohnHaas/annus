What is ANNUS?

- javascript implementation of neural networks and probabilistic
  graphical models
- easy graphing and integration with web visualization libraries
- allow users to interactively "draw" training examples to give to the
  learning algorithms as input.

We hope that this can be used as a teaching tool to help students gain
intuition about machine learning algorithms.
